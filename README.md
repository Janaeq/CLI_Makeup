# Makeup Finder

Thanks for using my first CLI gem! 
This application uses a Makeup API to help users choose what makeup to buy. The user can search for makeup by product name and then search for that makeup product by brand (if they so choose).
Once they make a selection, information about that product will be displayed and the user will then be presented an option to buy that product.
If they choose to buy, a link where the product can be purchased will be displayed!

## Getting Started
Fork and clone this repository, and run the code 
```
'ruby bin/start'
```

## Built With
